The podium has a dark wood finish, and on its front is a circular emblem with the word \"Lilly\" written in white script.\n\nIn the background, a large, white, stylized \"Lilly\" logo is prominent against a deep red wall. Below the \"Lilly\" logo, the words \"A MEDICINE COMPANY\" are also displayed in white block letters. The lighting in the scene is focused on the man and the podium, with the background logo also well-illuminated. The overall impression is of a corporate event or presentation.",

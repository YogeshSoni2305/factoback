            "llama_response": "Claim is: Lion is king.\nOpponent's response: Critique: \n\nThe claim's weakness lies in relying on culturally-specific metaphorical language rather than a universally accepted definition. This may not be a direct, factual statement about lions themselves but a colloquialism derived from their ecological dominance in certain environments. A counter-claim could argue lions are indeed the kings of a specific habitat, justifying the idiomatic expression.",

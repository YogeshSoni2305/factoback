        "llama_response": "Critique: The claim is true, and the reasoning is sound. However, it would be strengthened by a direct citation of the National Archives of India death record, which is only mentioned as a source. This provides an additional layer of evidence, making the argument more robust.\n\nAccepting the verdict, remaining limitations include: \n\nThe National Archives of India record might be subject to change or modification, though this is unlikely. Additionally, while the Encyclopaedia Britannica is a reputable source, its information can be updated to reflect new findings or changes in historical scholarship.",

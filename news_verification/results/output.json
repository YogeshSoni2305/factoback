The text reads \"China in a Panic Mode!!\" on the first line, and \"Amidst Trump's Tariff, China to dump goods into India.\" on the subsequent lines. Below this, on a lighter colored background, is a smaller line of text that states \"Commerce Secretary to throttle China's Strategy\".\n\nThe bottom half of the image is a collage of three distinct elements. On the left, there is a picture of Xi Jinping, the President of China, with his eyes closed and his hand on his forehead, suggesting stress or deep thought. Behind him, a portion of the Chinese flag is visible. In the center, there is an illustration of a person in an orange coat and a hat looking through a telescope towards a landscape of shipping containers. To the right of this illustration, a man with a beard and wearing a black polo shirt with a logo is shown. On the far right, there is a close-up portrait of an older man with white hair and glasses, looking directly at the camera. The background behind these figures appears to be a simplified landscape with a blue sky and some stylized elements that could represent trade or industry. A small Indian flag symbol is also visible in the bottom right corner of the illustrative section. The bottom right corner also has a watermark with dimensions \"686 x 386\"."

### Claim: Mahatma Gandhi is dead.

**DeepSeek Response:**

```
: True  
Reasoning: Mohandas K. Gandhi was assassinated on 30 January 1948 in New Delhi; all reputable historical records list his death on that date.  
Sources: Encyclopaedia Britannica entry “Mahatma Gandhi”; National Archives of India death record.
```

**LLaMA Response:**

```
Critique: The claim is true, and the reasoning is sound. However, it would be strengthened by a direct citation of the National Archives of India death record, which is only mentioned as a source. This provides an additional layer of evidence, making the argument more robust.

Accepting the verdict, remaining limitations include: 

The National Archives of India record might be subject to change or modification, though this is unlikely. Additionally, while the Encyclopaedia Britannica is a reputable source, its information can be updated to reflect new findings or changes in historical scholarship.
```
